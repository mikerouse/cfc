## ðŸŽ¯ Fix Summary: Counter Cache Invalidation

### Before Fix
```
User edits financial figure â†’ Data saved to DB â†’ Counter cache remains stale
                              â†“
User sees old counter values (until 10min cache expires)
```

### After Fix  
```
User edits financial figure â†’ Data saved to DB â†’ Cache invalidated â†’ Counter updates immediately
                              â†“                   â†“
User sees updated counter values instantly! âœ…
```

### Technical Implementation

**Files Modified:**
1. `council_finance/views/council_edit_api.py` - Individual figure edits
2. `council_finance/views/general.py` - Bulk figure saves

**Cache Keys Invalidated:**
- `counter_values:{council_slug}:{year_label}` (financial figures)
- All years for characteristics changes (affects all calculations)

**Key Benefits:**
- âœ… **Immediate feedback** - No refresh needed
- âœ… **Consistent UX** - All edit methods work the same
- âœ… **Zero performance impact** - Minimal cache operations
- âœ… **Transaction safe** - Cache cleared after DB commits

### Test Scenario Resolved
1. âœ… Go to Aberdeen council detail page
2. âœ… Edit â†’ Financial Data â†’ 2024/25 â†’ Usable Reserves = 153607000
3. âœ… Save & Earn 3pts
4. âœ… Back to council page
5. âœ… **Counter shows updated value immediately** (no refresh needed!)

The issue where "figures are not showing on the Usable Reserves counter" is now **completely resolved**.
