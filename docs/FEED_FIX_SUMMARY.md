# Feed Display Inconsistency Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: Feed behavior was inconsistent between councils:
- **Aberdeen**: Showed rich financial displays with values like "£89.5m" 
- **Cornwall**: Showed only basic text like "Updated Current Liabilities for Cornwall Council (2024/25)"

## Root Cause 🔍

The `ActivityStoryGenerator` was failing to process Cornwall entries due to:

1. **Activity Type Mismatch**: API logged activities as `'data_edit'` but story generator only processed `['create', 'update']`
2. **Missing Year Field**: Story generator expected `'year'` in details for financial context
3. **Field Name Format**: Story generator expected slug format but API stored display names

## Solution Implemented 🛠️

### Backend Fixes:
- **Fixed activity logging** in `council_edit_api.py`:
  - Changed activity type from `'data_edit'` → `'update'`
  - Added `'year'` field to activity details
  - Fixed field naming: `'field_name'` = slug, `'field_display_name'` = human name

- **Enhanced story generator**:
  - Added backward compatibility for existing `'data_edit'` entries
  - Extended financial formatting to include `'calculated'` category

### Frontend Enhancements:
- **Rich financial highlights** with:
  - Gradient backgrounds and visual patterns
  - Large, bold financial values (£50.0m)
  - Percentage change indicators with icons
  - Council badges and contextual information
  - Social media-friendly styling
