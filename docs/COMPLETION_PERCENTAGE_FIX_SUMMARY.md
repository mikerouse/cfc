# Council Edit Completion Percentage Fix - Implementation Summary
**Date**: 9-10 August 2025
**Branch**: feature/ai-pdf-processing

## Executive Summary
Fixed critical issues with the council edit page showing incorrect completion percentages (0% when data existed) and competing progress calculations causing flickering values. Implemented a real-time AJAX-based solution focused on current financial year data only.

## Problems Identified & Fixed

### 1. Incorrect 0% Completion Display
**Problem**: Aberdeen City Council showed "Financial Data: 0% complete" despite having business rates income, government grants, and other data entered.

**Root Cause**: Progress calculation was based on DOM element parsing instead of actual database queries.

**Solution**: Created new API endpoint `/api/council/<slug>/completion/` that queries the database directly for accurate percentages.

### 2. Competing Progress Calculations
**Problem**: User saw "45% appears to start with then it updates to 20% after a second or two" - multiple systems calculating different values.

**Root Cause**: Legacy `spreadsheet_editor.js` DOM-based calculation competing with new React API-based system.

**Solution**: Disabled legacy `updateProgress()` methods in `spreadsheet_editor.js` to prevent competition.

### 3. Mixed Category Percentages
**Problem**: Overall percentage included non-financial fields (general, characteristics) instead of focusing on what matters most.

**Solution**: Changed API to focus on financial fields only for the overall percentage, keeping current year as priority.

### 4. Calculated Fields Bug
**Problem**: Calculated fields were being counted in completion percentage, incorrectly lowering the score.

**Solution**: Filtered to only include `['balance_sheet', 'income', 'spending']` categories, excluding 'calculated' fields.

## Technical Implementation

### New API Endpoint
**File**: `council_finance/views/council_edit_api.py`
```python
@login_required
@require_http_methods(['GET'])
def council_completion_percentage_api(request, council_slug, year_id=None):
    """
    Calculate accurate completion percentages using database queries.
    Focus on current financial year only.
    """
    # Returns:
    {
        "success": true,
        "completion": {
            "overall": {
                "total_fields": 9,      # Financial fields only
                "complete": 9,
                "percentage": 100       # Based on financial data
            },
            "focus": {
                "year_label": "100% complete for 2024/25",
                "financial_progress": 100
            }
        }
    }
```

### React Component Updates
**File**: `frontend/src/components/CouncilEditApp.jsx`
- Added `updateCompletionProgress()` function using new API
- Replaced DOM-based progress tracking with API calls
- Updated console logging to show year-focused progress

### Legacy Code Disabled
**File**: `council_finance/static/js/spreadsheet_editor.js`
```javascript
// DISABLED: Legacy updateProgress method - React system now handles all progress
async updateProgress() {
    console.log('ðŸš« Legacy spreadsheet_editor.js updateProgress() disabled - React system now active');
    return;
}
```

### URL Routing
**File**: `council_finance/urls.py`
```python
# Completion percentage calculation
path("api/council/<slug:council_slug>/completion/", council_edit_api.council_completion_percentage_api),
path("api/council/<slug:council_slug>/completion/<int:year_id>/", council_edit_api.council_completion_percentage_api),
```

## React Build System Fixes

### Vite Template Tag Issue
**Problem**: React assets returned 404 errors for `main.js` and `main.css`

**Cause**: Vite template tags use stable filenames in development but build creates hashed files

**Solution**: Copied hashed files to expected names:
- `main-DOFL_3yw.js` â†’ `main.js`
- `main-CWCzAves.css` â†’ `main.css`

## Data Migration Completed

### Financial Data Standardization
**Problem**: Mixed storage formats - some values in millions, some in pounds

**Solution**: 
1. Created migration command `migrate_financial_data_to_pounds.py`
2. Migrated 4 records from millions to pounds:
   - Birmingham: Â£628.16M â†’ Â£628,160,000
   - Cornwall: Â£644.13M â†’ Â£644,130,000  
   - Shropshire: Â£271.00M â†’ Â£271,000,000
   - Worcestershire: Â£208.49M â†’ Â£208,487,000

## UI/UX Improvements

### Phase 1 GOV.UK Style Implementation
- Removed rounded corners per user preference
- Fixed Â£ symbol positioning (moved outside input field)
- Implemented view/edit modes for existing data
- Added data validation modals for unrealistic values
- Created success navigation modal with clear CTAs

### Component Structure
```
CouncilEditApp.jsx (Main orchestrator)
â”œâ”€â”€ CategorySelection.jsx (Step 1: Choose category)
â”œâ”€â”€ CategoryFieldEntry.jsx (Step 2: Enter data)
â”œâ”€â”€ SmartFieldEditor.jsx (Individual field editor)
â”œâ”€â”€ ChangeSummary.jsx (Review changes)
â”œâ”€â”€ DataValidationModal.jsx (Data validation warnings)
â”œâ”€â”€ SaveSuccessModal.jsx (Post-save navigation)
â””â”€â”€ ProgressTracker.jsx (Progress display)
```

## Testing Results

### Aberdeen City Council
- **Before**: 0% complete (DOM parsing issue)
- **After**: 100% complete for 2024/25 (9/9 financial fields)

### API Response Example
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "completion": {
        "overall": {
            "total_fields": 9,
            "complete": 9,
            "percentage": 100
        },
        "focus": {
            "year_label": "100% complete for 2024/25",
            "is_current_year": true,
            "financial_progress": 100
        }
    }
}
```

## Benefits Delivered

2. **No More Flickering**: Single source of truth for progress
3. **Year-Focused**: Prioritizes current financial year completion
4. **Financial Focus**: Overall percentage based on financial data only
5. **Real-time Updates**: AJAX-based for concurrent multi-user editing
6. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design with 44px touch targets
7. **Data Integrity**: All financial values now stored in pounds

## Files Modified

### Backend

- `council_finance/urls.py` - Added completion API routes
- `council_finance/models/counter.py` - Removed smart detection logic
- `council_finance/static/js/spreadsheet_editor.js` - Disabled competing code

### Frontend

- `frontend/src/components/council-edit/*.jsx` - New UI components
- `static/frontend/main.js` - Rebuilt with fixes

### Templates
- `council_finance/templates/council_finance/council_detail_edit.html` - React integration
- `council_finance/templates/council_finance/council_edit_react.html` - Vite integration

## Known Issues Resolved
- âœ… 0% completion when data exists
- âœ… Progress flickering (45% â†’ 20%)
- âœ… Calculated fields counted incorrectly
- âœ… Mixed data storage formats
- âœ… React assets 404 errors
- âœ… Â£ symbol obscuring input values
- âœ… Missing data validation

## Deployment Notes
1. Run `npx vite build` to rebuild React components
2. Copy built files to stable names for development
3. Ensure Django server reloads to pick up URL changes
4. Authentication required for completion API endpoint

## Future Considerations
- When current year (2024/25) reaches 100%, system could show previous year progress
- Consider caching completion calculations for performance
- Add pending/draft status tracking if needed
