# AGENTS.md

Read the AGENTS.md file for detailed instructions.

## Creator's rules

- We care about comments. There should be useful and descriptive comments.
- We care about helpers in the UI for the benefit of users.
- We care about realtime and live data using websockets or polling.
- We care about taking a holistic app-wide view - this means if we adjust functionality that affects one place we look around the app to see where else might be affected and act accordingly.
- We prioritise the user experience and ease-of-use. That means we do not use things like alert() we use modals instead.
- We care about accessibility, but not when it compromises design. We should do both.
- We log, log, log.
- We like loading indicators and progress indicators.
- We like verbose status and debugging information.
- We delete old work and replace it with better.
- We don't do stub implementations, we do things properly.
- We build with the future in mind.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Test each migrated agent as a standalone unit:

```bash
python manage.py runagent ImporterAgent --source "https://example.com/figures.csv"
```

Write tests in `agents/tests/` for each module:

```python
class CounterAgentTest(TestCase):
    def test_basic_debt_calculation(self):
        agent = CounterAgent()
        result = agent.run(year=2023)
        self.assertGreater(result['debt'], 0)
```

## ðŸ›  Configuration

- Use `.env` files for API keys and database URLs.
- `config/settings.py` is loaded dynamically and supports overrides via environment.
- Store config overrides or user-specified parameters via a `settings` model or flatfile.

## ðŸ”„ Scheduling

Use cron or Django-Q/Celery for periodic agents (e.g. daily imports):

```cron
0 3 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python manage.py runagent ImporterAgent
```
